# Subdue

**Self-hosted subscription tracker.** Your subscriptions, their due dates, and what they actually cost — in one place you own.

> Subdue: subscription **due** dates — and a good verb for taking control of them.

**Status: early, but alive.** Dashboard (with pay-period budgets), calendar, subscriptions, and the reminder inbox are live in the browser, backed by a tested engine for recurrence, currencies, and monthly totals. Everything from subscriptions to integrations is managed in the browser, reminders deliver through email, ntfy, Telegram, Discord, and webhooks, and your data moves in and out freely — JSON, CSV, a one-file backup, and a Wallos importer that reads the real thing.

## Why

Subscription trackers keep getting solved and unsolved at the same time: clouds that charge a monthly fee to track your monthly fees, self-hosted tools that get 90% right and stall on the last 10%, and "simple CRUD" apps where the recurrence math quietly lies to you.

Subdue is our answer to all three. Four principles:

- **Your data is yours.** One SQLite file, one folder of logos. A backup is a file copy; a restore is putting it back.
- **Boring deployment.** One container, one volume, fine on a NAS. No database to babysit, no account to create.
- **Boringly correct.** Recurrence, time zones, currencies — pure functions with tests. The 31st of January exists; we plan for it.
- **Typed through the stack.** Database schema to rendered DOM, no stringly-typed handshakes in between.

## Roadmap

Directions, not promises. Each milestone should end in something usable and tested.

### M0 — Foundation (current)

- [x] TanStack Start + TypeScript scaffold
- [x] SQLite with WAL and a sane busy timeout, from the first migration
- [x] Drizzle schema + migrations that run on boot
- [x] Single-user login (multi-user designed in, not bolted on later)
- [x] User settings (currency, locale, week start, theme)

### M1 — Track

- [x] Subscriptions: price, cycle (custom N× days/weeks/months/years), categories, payment methods, notes
- [x] Recurrence engine: next payment, prior payments, overdue — specified and tested before it ships
- [x] Currencies with daily exchange rates (ECB, no API key needed)

### M2 — See

- [x] Dashboard: monthly cost, upcoming payments, what changed since last month
- [x] Calendar view
- [x] Budgets, including pay-period anchoring

### M3 — Get told

- [x] Reminders: N days before a charge, with per-subscription overrides
- [x] Channels: SMTP email first, then ntfy / Telegram / Discord / generic webhooks
- [x] An in-app inbox so nothing gets missed

### M4 — Fit into the house

- [x] Import from Wallos backups and CSV
- [x] Export: JSON/CSV and a one-file backup
- [x] iCal feed
- [x] REST API (API keys) — for scripts, dashboards, and MCP servers
- [x] MCP server — OAuth-protected tools for MCP clients (read-only for now)
- [x] PWA (installable; offline behaviour is [#8](https://github.com/LovelessCodes/Subdue/issues/8))

### M5 — Ship it properly

- [x] Docker image: one volume, healthcheck, self-migrating
- [x] CI that runs lint, typecheck, and tests on every pull request
- [x] Release automation (tag-driven image + notes; the first tag is yours to cut)

### Explicit non-goals (for now)

- Feature parity with anything — parity with how people actually use it is the goal.
- AI recommendations, gamification, engagement loops.
- A mobile app before the web app is excellent on a phone.

## Development

Needs [Bun](https://bun.sh) (preferred) or a recent Node.

First run: `cp .env.example .env`. Everything in it is optional — the auth secret is generated on first boot (stored next to the database) and the base URL is derived from requests. Then open Subdue, create an account, and claim the administrator role: the claim URL is printed to the server logs on first boot.

```bash
bun install                # dependencies
bun run dev                # http://localhost:3000
bun run build              # production build
bun run check              # oxlint + oxfmt --check
bun run format             # rewrite files with oxfmt
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
bun run test               # vitest
bun run start              # production server (after bun run build)
```

`src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by TanStack Router on dev/build — don't edit it by hand. `src/lib/auth-schema.ts` is generated from the better-auth config (`bunx auth@latest generate`) — don't edit it by hand either. Migrations in `drizzle/` apply automatically on server boot; after schema changes, create the next one with `bunx drizzle-kit generate`.

UI components are copy-in files in `src/components/ui` (shadcn/ui on Base UI — add more with `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <name>`). The theme lives in `src/styles.css`, and scroll containers can use the shipped `scroll-fade` utility: `<ScrollArea viewportClassName="scroll-fade">`.

## Deploy

**Docker, built locally:**

```bash
docker build -t subdue .
docker run -d --name subdue -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/data subdue
```

**Docker Compose:** copy `.env.example` to `.env` (all values optional) and `docker compose up -d`.

One volume (`/data`) holds the SQLite database — WAL mode, so the `-wal` and `-shm` files travel with it — plus the `logos/` folder for uploaded images. Migrations run automatically on every boot: upgrading is pulling a new image. On a fresh install the logs print a claim URL (`docker compose logs subdue | grep Subdue`) and the account that opens it becomes the administrator — the token lives at `data/setup-token` and is deleted once claimed. Tagged releases publish a multi-arch image to `ghcr.io/lovelesscodes/subdue`:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0   # builds amd64 + arm64, writes release notes
```

Nothing needs configuring for a LAN deploy: the auth secret is generated into the data volume on first boot, and the base URL is derived from each request, so localhost, LAN names and IPs all work. Four settings are worth knowing:

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` — set it only if you want to control it. The generated secret lives beside the database (`/data/secret`); keep the two together. Changing the secret no longer breaks stored signing keys (they are written unencrypted at rest — the database itself is the sensitive file — and key rows from older versions are repaired on boot); existing sessions do log out.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` — optional; set it to pin OAuth/MCP callback URLs to one public URL.
- `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` — defaults to `*` (any origin), which suits self-hosting. Narrow it (comma-separated) if the instance is reachable from the internet.
- `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` — set to `true` when a reverse proxy in front sets `x-forwarded-for`. Otherwise incoming values are ignored and the socket address is used, so the per-IP rate limits cannot be spoofed.
- `MCP_RESOURCE_URL` — set it to your public `/api/mcp` if you use MCP clients.
  The container runs as root and writes to `/data`; on a NAS, pre-create that folder with your own ownership if it matters to you.

## API & docs

- **Interactive reference** (Scalar): `/api/auth/reference` on a running instance — covers every endpoint, including the plugin ones.
- **Machine-readable spec**: [`openapi.json`](./openapi.json); regenerate with `bun run openapi` after endpoint changes.
- **MCP**: the app serves an MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp`, protected by OAuth (dynamic client registration, CIMD, PKCE). Point an MCP client at `http://localhost:3000/api/mcp` — it discovers the authorization server, and you approve access on the consent page.
- **Scripts & API keys**: `POST /api/auth/api-key/create` returns a key (shown once). Call any endpoint with `x-api-key: <key>` instead of a session cookie — keys are full-access per user, rate-limited (600 requests/hour), and revocable through the same API. A management UI is [#7](https://github.com/LovelessCodes/Subdue/issues/7).

## Notifications

Reminders deliver through any combination of channels — configure them on the Channels page (endpoints remain for scripts):

| Type       | Config                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `email`    | `{ host, port, secure, username, password, from, to }`   |
| `ntfy`     | `{ server, topic, token? }`                              |
| `telegram` | `{ botToken, chatId }`                                   |
| `discord`  | `{ webhookUrl }`                                         |
| `webhook`  | `{ url, secret? }` — JSON POST `{ title, body, source }` |

```bash
# with your session cookie in cookies.txt
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/channels/create \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{"type":"ntfy","name":"Phone","config":{"topic":"my-subs"}}'
```

Every send is queued and retried up to three times — the Channels page shows recent deliveries with their last error and can test any channel with one click. The reminder tick runs in-process every five minutes — no cron to configure.

## Moving your data

Three exports, all session-gated file downloads:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -O -J http://localhost:3000/api/export/json     # versioned JSON bundle
curl -b cookies.txt -O -J http://localhost:3000/api/export/csv      # round-trippable CSV
curl -b cookies.txt -O -J http://localhost:3000/api/export/backup   # full SQLite copy (VACUUM INTO)
```

Two imports, both with a dry run that reports exactly what would happen without writing anything:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/import/wallos?dryRun=1' \
  --data-binary @Wallos-Backup-20260101-120000.zip
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/import/csv?dryRun=1' \
  --data-binary @subdue-subscriptions-2026-01-01.csv
```

The Wallos importer reads the raw `wallos.db` inside a backup zip (a bare `.db` works too) and follows Wallos semantics: cycle days plus frequency become Subdue cycles, decimal prices become minor units, per-subscription reminder overrides carry over, and logos, URLs, payment methods and cancellation dates come along too. Duplicate names are skipped; inactive subscriptions and one-time payments are reported rather than imported.

Logos are files in the data folder (`data/logos/`), so a complete backup is the database plus that folder; the JSON export records the filenames.

## Calendar feed

Subscribe your calendar to Subdue — every payment in the next 12 months, expanded by the same recurrence engine that powers the app, with an alarm set from each subscription's reminder days (per-subscription overrides included):

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/ical/enable
# → { "token": "...", "path": "/api/ical/<token>" }
```

Add `http://localhost:3000/api/ical/<token>` as a calendar subscription in anything that speaks iCal (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Fastmail…). Rotate with `/api/auth/ical/rotate`, revoke with `/api/auth/ical/disable`. The URL is a bearer credential — treat it like a password.

## Install it

Subdue is a PWA: it installs from any modern browser (manifest, icons, theme color). Pages are cached network-first, so whenever the server is reachable the data is fresh; when it is not, the last-rendered copy appears with a banner naming the cache time. API calls are never cached. The reasoning and its trade-offs live in [docs/adr/0001-offline-behaviour.md](./docs/adr/0001-offline-behaviour.md).

## Two-factor authentication

TOTP two-factor is per account: **Settings → Two-factor authentication**. Enabling asks for your password, shows a QR code plus the secret for manual entry, and issues ten single-use backup codes — the account is only protected once you verify the first code, which is better-auth's rule and a good one. Sign-in then asks for a code, backup codes work as recovery, and turning two-factor off revokes remembered verification. Nothing to configure on the server side.

## Social sign-in

Two first-class ways to configure providers — the environment wins when they overlap:

**In the browser:** an administrator opens `/admin`, picks from 34 providers, pastes the credentials plus any provider-specific fields (Microsoft tenant, Cognito domain/region/pool, Discord permissions, Facebook scopes, …), registers the callback URL shown, and restarts Subdue. Secrets live in the database and are never returned by the API.

**In the container:** environment variables follow `${PROVIDER}_CLIENT_ID` / `${PROVIDER}_CLIENT_SECRET`, with extras as `${PROVIDER}_${KEY}`:

```bash
docker run … \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=… -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=… \
  -e MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=contoso \
  -e COGNITO_REGION=eu-west-1 -e COGNITO_USERPOOL_ID=eu-west-1_abc \
  -e DISCORD_PERMISSIONS=8,2048
```

Providers configured by environment show as "from environment" on the admin page and stay read-only there until the variables are removed. The sign-in and sign-up pages grow the matching buttons automatically.

## Contributing

Very early days: for anything structural, please open an issue before a big pull request so we can agree on the shape first. Small fixes are welcome as-is.

## Credits & thanks

- **[Wallos](https://github.com/ellite/Wallos)** — the self-hosted subscription tracker that showed this category deserves to exist. Subdue is an independent, from-scratch rebuild: it shares no code with Wallos and is not affiliated with it. The nod is one of respect — if you want a mature tracker today, go run Wallos.
- **[TanStack](https://tanstack.com)** — for Start, Router, and making the web fun again.
- Every self-hoster who would rather run `docker compose up` than rent another subscription.
